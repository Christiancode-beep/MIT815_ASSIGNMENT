# UNILAG Event Registration

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based event registration system designed for UNILAG students. It allows students to register for events by providing their personal and academic details through a multi-step form. The system dynamically validates user inputs and adapts the form based on the selected academic level (Undergraduate or Postgraduate).
